# GitHub Tutorial Project

## _Overview_  

* _Using markdown syntax_, display all of your knowledge about **Git** and **Github** in a single README file.  

## _Directions_

DRIVER - 
1. Create a NEW repository on GITHUB called - github-tutorial
2. Copy the SSH Link
3. Clone it to your IDE (it will say it is EMPTY that is OK)

5. As you edit, make a commit every once in a while.  Don't forget to push

NAVIGATOR - 
1. Open up your NOTES, Slide Decks, the SEP10 Site

### A note about plagiarism
You should be typing _every single word_.  It is ok to refer to your notes, the slides, the internet, and even your classmates for help.  However, **intellectual property is to be regarded highly in this class**.  You should be explaining everything in your own words.  If you are copying/pasting, you are not learning.

### Assumptions
Should you assume your reader is a student at HSTAT?  Should you assume they already use the CS50 IDE?  It is _up to you_ to decide what assumptions you will make.  But perhaps the best strategy is to speak to all audiences with hints for HSTAT / ide50.  
i.e. making a Github account:
> Choose a username (if you are a student at HSTAT, use your HSTAT email, but without the `@hstat.org`).

### Final thoughts
The best way to learn something is through repeated practice.  
Feel free to **practice** all of these concepts on your own to understand them better.
